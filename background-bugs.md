Feedback on Coursework
======================

Bugs, questions and suggestions
-------------------------------

This coursework is in its second year, though others
will be new this year. The previous years students
were very helpful, and we fixed a lot of bugs. However,
other may remain. That is fine, and some level of
imperfction is fine - you are all masters-level students.

Typical types of feedback I'm interested in on this
(and all courseworks) are:

- Questions: if something in the instructions is unclear,
  then it might be me who hasn't explained it well.
  
- Bugs: there are likely to be parts of the specification
  or code that are flat-out wrong. Usually it will be obvious
  what I meant (e.g. typos in function names), but it
  is good to fix them.
  
- Suggestions: sometimes there are better ways of
  explaining something, or helpful suggestions for
  making things work on particular platforms. It is
  good to share.
  
There are certain types of feedback I'm less interested
in, specifically:

- "This is too hard" : The first four courseworks are
  designed to encourage learning, not measure it. As
  a consequence, if you find it hard, that means there
  is something you _really_ need to learn for the final
  two courseworks.
  
- "This is too easy" : Some people will find one, or
  possibly all, of the first four courseworks quite
  easy. Beware - if you are able to rattle though
  the coding, it may mean you are not picking up
  some of the deeper concepts. Or maybe it is all
  too easy - good for you.
  
- "This takes too long" : The first four courseworks
  are instructional, and will require many people
  to read things, look stuff up, and learn some
  new skills. The coursework _is_ the learning,
  which includes both the actual time spent typing,
  but also the time spent learning new skills. That
  said, I have streamlined certain tasks for this year.

How to report a problem
-----------------------

In order of preference, your options are:

1. Pull requests: If you know what the problem is, and
   know how to fix it, pull requests are greatly appreciated
   (don't worry if you don't know what that means).

2. File an issue: you can report problems or ask questions on the
   [issues](https://github.com/HPCE/hpce-2015-cw1/issues) page.
   This allows everyone to see it, so everyone can benefit.

3. Ask me: asking questions in/after lectures is a good
    way of checking simple things.

The reason for emphasising the first two methods is
that it is easier to manage, and everyone benefits
from the updates. A reason I don't list email is because
the first two methods will automatically email me
anyway, but unlike an email othe people can see that
the question has been asked (and may be able to
answer it before me).

Bug reports and fixes are an important professional
activity, so wherever possible I will attribute
improvements to the people who suggest them.

When reporting bugs or asking questions, please
think carefully about what you are asking, and
make the context clear. Any questions which look
like the following (all of which reflect single-sentence
emails I've received in the past) will be
pretty much ignored.

- "It isn't clear what to do in exercise E3.1."

- "Function X doesn't work. Is it broken?"

- "My program crashes. Do you know why?"

- "How fast should my function Y be?"

Please make sure that you have included enough
context for someone else to help you, such as:

- What were you trying to do?

- What did you expect to happen?

- What happened instead?

- Were there any error messages?

- What possible fixes have you already tried?

Not all of these will be appropriate in all
circumstances, so use your discretion. A longer
former discussion is [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)
